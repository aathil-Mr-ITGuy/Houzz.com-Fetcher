"Feinmann, Inc.",427294,"Lexington, Massachusetts, United States",Lexington,MA,02421,US,81,4.9,"Second time working with them. First for a large kitchen, now for a master bath. Both times they were outstanding start to finish. We were able to live through the renovations because of our complete trust in the team each day to be in and out of our home. Expertly managed by Matt for a nearly perfect “transformative” outcome. Highly recommended.",HU-830847790

MAK Design + Build Inc.,1593642,"Davis, California, United States",Davis,CA,95616,US,80,4.9,"MAK did an amazing job, as we knew they would, on our beautiful new bathroom and entry closet. We love the way the project turned out.  Our designer, Kellie Love somehow turned a tiny drab bathroom into my favorite room—sanctuary of the house.   Matt Bozdech  was a dream to work with and exceeded all expectations in terms of responsiveness and making sure every detail came out just as we had planned.  With him leading the build, no issue fell by the wayside.
 
It was a pleasure working with MAK throughout the course of our project, and the final product is a dream come true.",Naomi Kaplowitz
OTM Designs & Remodeling Inc.,1761992,"Sherman Oaks, California, United States",Sherman Oaks,CA,91403,US,81,4.9,"Exceptional craftsmanship and a seamless remodeling experience! That is what I experienced by hiring the OTM Designs & Remodeling team. From the initial meeting to the final finishing touches, Offer and Ranj and the entire team did not disappoint me. I was always informed of the process, schedules and timelines. Aside from that, they even helped me pick out every detail of finishing materials that we needed for the project. I completed an entire home remodel which included the full kitchen and my two bathrooms. All the intricacies of the tilework, countertop, and all the aspects were all executed flawlessly. They have great attention to detail. Their professionalism to their craftsmanship were truly commendable. I definitely would recommend OTM Designs!",Lance West
"Creative Design Construction, Inc.",1967866,"Northvale, New Jersey, United States",Northvale,NJ,07647,US,113,4.9,"The Creative team just completed a complete renovation of our 35 year old home and we are thrilled with the result.  They took an old, tired home and made it completely new for the 21st century. New kitchen, windows, doors, flooring, bathrooms, insulation, and interior design, they did it all. Glen, Aimee, and Hairo were the lead team members that we worked with and they put together a complete plan and budget that addressed all our needs.  Their creative thinking on the job was also greatly appreciated.  Doing a whole home renovation is expensive, time consuming, and, at times, stressful, but the Creative team met all the challenges and the result is a new home we will enjoy for years to come.  One final note.  Creative is a team of true professionals in all the trades that touch a job like this.  The electrician, plumber, painter, carpenters, and security/entertainment teams are outstanding.  I highly recommend Glen and his team to anyone looking for work that is of the highest standards.",Bob Griffin
J.P. Hoffman Design Build,2521736,"Bridgewater, Massachusetts, United States",Bridgewater,MA,02324,US,66,5.0,"We reached out to J.P. Hoffman to help with the renovation of our basement. From the minute we met with Jason and Megan, we knew we were in very good hands. They were so transparent throughout the whole process, making sure we were aligned at every step and aware of all our options as we planned our dream space. Jason, Megan, and the whole team were extremely courteous and bring a wealth of experience to draw from. The end result was better than we could have ever dreamed of, and to say this company is professional, efficient, and thorough is an understatement. We highly recommend J.P. Hoffman and look forward to working with them again.",Omer Z.

It is all beautiful!  Working with the SeaPointe team was a pleasure.  They are professional, creative, responsive and great to work with.  Janna, my designer, was key in the design and detail.  Aaron and his team, especially George and Elias, kept things on schedule and made sure all done right.  The whole team and contractors did a quality job on cabinetry, tile, flooring, etc.  I highly recommend SeaPointe for any remodeling project.",amdr3154
Design Studio West,5244623,"San Diego, California, United States",San Diego,CA,92117,US,54,5.0,"Karina Borg at Design Studio West gave us the kitchen we wanted, needed and could afford! Her thoughtful choices and attention to detail gave us confidence throughout the process. We went from a tiny 70’s u-shape to a sleek entertainer’s kitchen that our friends all say is their dream kitchen. Somehow, our new space is so organized it feels like it cleans itself after a party. The team at Design Studio West far exceeded our expectations for listening, planning, guidance and follow through.",annyerkes
CairnsCraft Design & Remodel,8094920,"San Diego, California, United States",San Diego,CA,92107,US,92,5.0,"We worked with CairnsCraft for our kitchen remodel and wholeheartedly recommend working with Charles and Marie. From the design to the final product, our experience was positive! We have a small galley kitchen and pantry area and love the results--both beautiful and functional. Planning, coordination, and communication were always excellent as was attention to detail. Marie and Anne were immediately responsive to any questions. We really liked the scheduling program, so we knew what to expect day to day and week to week. And we finished on time! Thank you!",Vonna Cummins
Northland Design & Build,10952346,"Sherwood, Oregon, United States",Sherwood,OR,97140,US,87,5.0,"Northland Design & Build did a fantastic job on our Kitchen/Family Room renovation. This was our 1st ever renovation, so we really didn't know what to expect. Working with them was such a blessing. They came by to view our space, and at that initial meeting, we knew they were the best fit for our project. They were so friendly, and no question was off limits it really put us at ease. From there, it was go time, we had several meetings discussing design/budget/time frame, and they moved like a well-oiled machine. The design process was fun but a bit overwhelming for me because I can be indecisive, my designer, Alicia, helped me focus on what I really wanted in the space, and she helped me feel confident about my decisions. She was able to help guide me on final decisions. I truly valued her voice and input because she wanted to ensure we loved the space. Brian was our project manager, and he and his team executed all the designs. When there were any hiccups with the time frame or design changes on our part, they were flexible and made it work. They have such a vast knowledge that I was always asking questions during the process, and they were always happy to answer questions to help me understand what was happening. One of the things I truly appreciated was the team of people always stayed the same, and they were always on time. I knew the people who would be coming to my home, and the work they did was excellent quality. They only worked with the best painters, flooring, and cabinetry contractors, so we trusted that the final project would turn out great. We love our space and have found a great construction company we trust, so we know who to call for future projects.",Jeremy & Amara Bolds
Streamline Construction,14594161,"Mission Viejo, California, United States",Mission Viejo,CA,92691,US,72,5.0,"If you are considering working with Streamline, do not think twice - hire them and you will not be disappointed. I would give them 10 stars if I could.

My wife and I hired Jason and the Streamline crew to completely renovate our 2BR/2BA Dana Point vacation condo down to the studs, which included major structural changes to completely open up the ocean facing main living area. We live in NorCal and were very concerned about how a remodel of this scope would go being a plane ride away. Not only did they execute to perfection from day 1 to project completion, but along the way they made us feel like it was their house too. Project management was 10/10. They use Buildetrend and were great with keeping us updated in real time on progress photos and execution schedules. Never had any issues getting ahold of someone when we needed to talk. Invoicing was also spot on with all the details you want to see when spending this kind of money. So much care and professionalism, even when we screwed up and asked them to make changes, they made us feel like it was ok and took care of everything without having to explain a second time. I would never use anyone else in Orange County if I had to build another house. We found our family at Streamline.

I'll be sure to update this post with professional photos when ready.",JC

Eli, the owner, Claire, the designer, and Jonathan, the project manager, collectively transformed my living space into a dream home.

In conclusion, I wholeheartedly recommend Eli, Clair, and  Jonathan for any home remodeling or addition project.

MY Home Builders Inc.,25982904,"Woodland Hills, California, United States",Woodland Hills,CA,91364,US,176,5.0,"MY Home Builders deserves high praise for their exceptional work on our ADU project. From the moment we engaged with their team, it was clear that they were committed to making the construction process as smooth as possible for us.

The construction team was punctual, organized, and demonstrated a strong work ethic. They communicated effectively at every stage, keeping us informed about progress and addressing any concerns promptly. The craftsmanship and attention to detail were evident in the final result.

OC Builders Group,56126888,"Santa Ana, California, United States",Santa Ana,CA,92701,US,105,5.0,"First and foremost, if OC Builders said they were going to do something, I slept well at night knowing they would. I cannot overstate how nice it was to never worry if things would get done. We never worried about crews showing up or work being done. People always showed up when they were scheduled to and we were always kept up to date on any scheduling changes.

From start to finish, OC Builders Group's communication with us was excellent. There was a daily text sharing the work done that day, the plan for the next day, and the crew's expected arrival time. Any questions or concerns we had were promptly responded to within the group text. Almost without fail, when we sent a text with a question or request, Brianda or Evan would respond within a few hours. It was impressive and an extremely nice experience. 

Rob and Brian worked with communicating what needed to be done with the crews and were both always willing to answer our questions and brainstorm solutions to the hiccups that come with doing construction.

Haim, our project manager, was a DREAM to work with. He always listened to our concerns and made sure they were addressed. It often felt like we didn't even need to fully explain our thoughts because he was so in-tune and just ""got it"" before we even said anything. Whenever we needed something, Haim made it happen. We would work with Haim again in a heartbeat.

When things went wrong, OC Builders was quick to remedy the issue. They were proactive in finding solutions and ultimately always made sure we were comfortable with the resolution. When we wanted things done differently or fixed, OC Builders fixed them without ever pushing back or complaining--no matter how major or minor the issue was. When a delay beyond their control happened, they re-worked the construction schedule and timeline to minimize the impact of the delay and keep things moving. When the paint in the corner of our dining room didn't turn out the way we wanted, they came back to fix it.

Overall, we are so pleased with how everything turned out and very grateful that our experience with OC Builders was a positive one--from our first consultation to our final walkthrough.",M B
